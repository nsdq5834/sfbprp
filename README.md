# sfbprp
Simple rust program to reconcile backup files on a Windows system.

sfbprp was/is written as a partner program ro sfbp. The program builds a list
of files on a backup location and checks to see if the source file still exists
on the source file system. If the file does not exist, it is removed from the 
backup location.

I am still in the early stages of learning rust and would welocme any and all
comments to help me improve the code.
